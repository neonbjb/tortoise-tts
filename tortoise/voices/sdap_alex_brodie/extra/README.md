These extra audio clips are generally harmful to include in the voice, when attempting to produce natural speech.

However, if a user wishes to elicit more obscure, non-speech vocalizations, these extra clips can be included in the main voice directory to influence the result.

As well, the many audio clips from this and the main directory can be tailored in specific combinations to create subset voices for different purposes or emotions. By collecting just the clips that sound angry, for example, a user can generate speech samples that sound more angry than when using all the audio clips together.

Here is an example of an angry subset for the `sdap_alex_brodie` voice:

```
miscellaneous_6_alex.wav
miscellaneous_13_alex.wav
refusal_1_alex.wav
refusal_2_alex.wav
refusal_7_alex.wav
refusal_8_alex.wav
refusal_9_alex.wav
refusal_10_alex.wav
shouting_1_alex.wav
shouting_2_alex.wav
shouting_6_alex.wav
```

By collecting *only* those audio clips into their own voice folder, an angry voice is produced which is somewhat consistent with the main voice.

> **Note:** The `shouting_` clips are not consistent across the different voices, so you must listen to those each to see if they fit with the tailored voice. But, the other clip categories containt the same content across voices, so it can be easy to assemble "recipes" for emotions that will work across all the voices, with only a bit of work needed to select the appropriate `shouting_` audio clips from each main voice.
